### Predicting weather is not very predictable if you only have measurements from a single location. The evolution of the weather where you are depends on current weather  atterns in surrounding locations. In addition,past performance is not a good predictor of future returnsâ€”looking in the rear-view mirror is a bad way to drive.
### This is a simple tutorial in which describe how a neural network can be used to predict weather tempreture.
### This can be used for other time series as well.
